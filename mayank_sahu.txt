You are fond of backend development and you want to help your college to build the backend for their student database management system.

{
    "students": [
        {
            "name": "User 1",
            "roll": "200",
            "courses_enrolled": ["c1", "c2", "c3"],
            "total_attendance": 100
        },
        {
            "name": "User 2",
            "roll": "201",
            "courses_enrolled": ["c2", "c3"],
            "total_attendance": 50
        },
        {
            "name": "User 3",
            "roll": "202",
            "courses_enrolled": ["c1", "c3"],
            "total_attendance": 75
        },
        {
            "name": "User 4",
            "roll": "203",
            "courses_enrolled": [],
            "total_attendance": 20
        },
        {
            "name": "User 5",
            "roll": "204",
            "courses_enrolled": ["c3"],
            "total_attendance": 30
        }
    ]
}

You are given a JSON object above, and this is to be stored in a MongoDB database. After that you have to design an API using expressJS library of NodeJS, where you have to implement the operations given below:

======================
API Endpoints required
======================

/get_students -> It should return a list of all the students studying in the college.

/enrolled_students -> It should return the names of those students who are enrolled in at least one course.

/gg_group -> It should return the names and roll numbers of those students who have attendance <= 30.

/course/x -> In this, let's say x = c1roll number then it will return the s of those students who are enrolled in course c1.
Example: /course/c1 -> Returns the roll numbers of those students who are enrolled in course c1.

/student/roll -> Here, let's say roll = 200, then it will display the complete details of the student with roll = 200
Example: /student/200 -> Returns the details of the student with roll = 200
